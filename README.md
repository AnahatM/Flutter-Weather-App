Enter a city name to get the current weather, or use your location to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
The project includes a WeatherService class to handle API interactions and a WeatherModel class to represent temperature and weather conditions.
Animations are from the Lottie library, used for the weather icons.
